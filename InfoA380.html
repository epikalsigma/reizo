<h3>This is the seat layout for an Airbus A380. This airline is British Airways, which also has the Airbus A380. The seats are REALLY luxurious. So you are considered lucky if you get to fly on the Airbus A380. If you get to fly on Business Class or First Class, woah.. The A380 is going to make you REALLY shocked.</h3>
