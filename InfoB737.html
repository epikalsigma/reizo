                 The Boeing 737 MAX is a more efficient version of the 737, seating 138 to 230 passengers with a range of 6,570 to 7,084 km. It is powered by two CFM LEAP-1B engines. However, early safety concerns arose due to the MCAS system, which malfunctioned, leading to two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019, killing 346 people. The aircraft was grounded and underwent safety upgrades, including software fixes and improved pilot training. Despite these changes, concerns still exist about the aircraft's safety. SO DO NOT RIDE THE UNSIGMA B737MAX, CANCEL FLIGHTS IF U R, ITS VERY DANGEROUS!!

    <h3>Here is the property of the B737-max: On April 17, 2023, an incident occurred with a Boeing 737 MAX operated by Alaska Airlines during a non-passenger ferry flight from Everett, Washington, to San Francisco, California. Shortly after takeoff, the autopilot system malfunctioned, causing the nose to pitch down unexpectedly.
 The pilots quickly took manual control and safely leveled the aircraft before landing without injuries or damage. The issue was linked to the flight control system but not directly related to the MCAS system. Boeing launched an investigation into the problem, raising new safety concerns about the aircraft. [1 crash story]</h3>

 <h3>Most flight on the B737-max survived, but its really risky. Better safe than sorry! Like for example, my father did not allow me to fly from Singapore To Shenzhen using the B737-max on Singapore Airlines as it is risky.</h3>
