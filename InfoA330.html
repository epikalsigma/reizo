    <h3>The Airbus A330 is a wide-body aircraft seating 250 to 300 passengers, designed for long-haul flights with a range of up to 6,500 nautical miles. In contrast, the A320 is a narrow-body aircraft that accommodates 140 to 240 passengers, ideal for short to medium-haul routes with a range of about 3,300 nautical miles. The A330 has larger engines and more spacious cabins, while the A320 typically offers single or dual-class layouts, making the A330 better for international travel and the A320 more suited for domestic flights.</h3>
    <h3>Here is the seat layout of the A330</h3>

        <h3>A320 has lesser seating than the A330. A330 has more Business Class seats.</h3>

    <h2>It also evolved into an Airbus A330neo. Meaning it became a larger aircraft.</h2>
